# Automation-of-height-retreival-from-shadows-in-sattelite-images

All instructions are provided in the code throught prompts. This MATLAB project was created keeping in mind open sourced sattelite images, like the ones provided by Sentinel, however, with slight modifications the code can output the height of any building that has been captured in any one type of aerial images. Also, I reccomend using arcgis to combine the multispectral image, you might want to refer to the tutorial here https://gisgeography.com/arcgis-composite-bands/

TO DO
